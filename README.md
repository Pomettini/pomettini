### Hi there, I'm Giorgio Pomettini (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working as a Unity Developer at [Third Kind Games](https://www.thirdkindgames.com/) in the beautiful city of Leamington Spa, UK

Even though I mostly write C# code at work, I also enjoy writing Rust, C, Lua and Javascript code in my spare time, mostly for command-line tools and small games for PC, mobile and retro consoles

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dreamquest), [Linkedin](https://it.linkedin.com/in/pomettini) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pomettini/)
