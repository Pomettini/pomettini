# Hi there, I'm Giorgio Pomettini (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working as a freelance Unity Developer in Rome, Italy

Even though I mostly write C# code for work, I also enjoy writing Rust, C, Lua and Javascript code in my spare time *(that is really limited at the moment)* mostly for command-line tools and small games for PC, mobile and retro consoles

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dreamquest), [Linkedin](https://it.linkedin.com/in/pomettini) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pomettini/)
